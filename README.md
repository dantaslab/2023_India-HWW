# India-HWW

Code and data used to generate figures / datatables associated with India hospital wastewater manuscript.

Each `.Rmd` file can be exported as an `.html` report by pressing the Knit button in RStudio.
 
By default, export directory structure (under `/reports`) is not created, and plots/datatables are NOT exported. The code for this is commented-out in `_common.R` and all `.Rmd` files. Remove the comments where indicated to export these as `.pdf`/`.csv`.
