Code and data used to generate figures / datatables associated with the India hospital wastewater project:

Talat A., Blake K.S., Dantas G., Khan A.U. Metagenomic insight into microbiome and antibiotic resistance genes of high clinical concern in urban and rural hospital wastewater of Northern India origin: a major reservoir of antimicrobial resistance. *Microbiology Spectrum.* 2023 Feb 14;e0410222. doi: 10.1128/spectrum.04102-22. PMID: 36786639. [LINK](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.04102-22)

Each `.Rmd` file can be exported as an `.html` report by pressing the Knit button in RStudio.
 
By default, export directory structure (under `/reports`) is not created, and plots/datatables are NOT exported. The code for this is commented-out in `_common.R` and all `.Rmd` files. Remove the comments where indicated to export these as `.pdf`/`.csv`.
